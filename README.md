Instructions



The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. 
You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 
This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.



To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality



For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

How to play

The goal is to match all cards, in the shortest amount of time, by clicking on the cards. 
You will be given a timer, star rating and moves counter to track your progress throughout the game. 
If you finish the game with a high star rating you have done exeptionally well but if you finish 
with a low star rating it might be worth while to play again.

Dependencies

- Font awesome
- jQuery
